# About
My name is Ken Kozma and I'm a full stack web developer living between the Philippines 🇵🇭 and the United States 🇺🇸.

I've spent the majority of my career building interactive and functional web interfaces that solve business problems and provide external value for large businesses, public figures and non-profit organizations. I thrive best in well-organized and remote environments where creativity and problem-solving skills can be utilized to produce value.

In my free time, you'll find me trying to balance being a father, running and synchronizing naps with my little one.
